## Demo

> _**Note**: by default **copy-dots** will ignore any filename with that contains `"git"` in it to avoid clobbering your local directory by accident.  Fear not!  You can enable support for this using our options (below ðŸ‘‡)!_

## Setup
Make sure to have [latest NodeJS LTS](https://nodejs.org/) installed.

## Usage

**copy-dots** has one required paramater, which is a path.  Additional options available to include other file types / patterns.

### Path (required)

**copy-dots** at least needs to know what path to copy your files from.

```sh
$ npx copy-dots ../../my-project
```

### Options (Coming Soon!)

**copy-dots** also support the following options to copy additional files.

- -l (License), 
- -g (git)
- -r (readme), 
- -w (all the flags)
- -c (config files)
